## Amax 
Amax is a web app that uses NLP to perform text analysis to generate questions, key points and a summary.

Amax can be used to strengthen one's understanding of information by quizzing themselves, reviewing the summary and inquiring about certain keywords.

Examples of information that could be inserted are paragraphs from textbooks, such as biology or history, information from encyclopedias, news articles, biographies and much more.
